Project 1: Implementation of Time-Varying Linear Filters for Audio Effects

The audio effects with three key time-varying linear filters:

- Wah-wah: Add rhythmic expressiveness.
- Phaser: Create sweeping, ethereal sounds.
- Flanger: Achieve captivating jet-like sweeps.

Implementation of the practical applications of these filters in audio processing. At the same time, you can test these implementations with the sound files in the repo.

Project 2: Three-Band Audio Equalizer with MATLAB GUI 

The project focused on implementing a three-band (low-mid-high) audio equalizer in MATLAB using a user-friendly GUI. Tune into the world of audio manipulation as you create a dynamic tool for adjusting frequencies.  

Project 3: Comprehensive Sound Processing System 

Implementation of immersive sound processing system that combines advanced signal processing techniques with practical functionality. This project reflecting the following features:

- Six-Band Equalizer: Manipulate audio frequencies across six distinct bands, customizing responses with up to Â±20 dB adjustments.
- Three Sound Effects: Implement captivating reverb, delay, and chorus effects using digital signal processing techniques.
- Recording and Monitoring: Seamlessly record input and output audio in ".wav" format and monitor real-time audio signals, visualizing through plotting.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Enhance usability with a meticulously designed GUI to effortlessly control and manage system functionalities.
- MATLAB Implementation: Utilize MATLAB to execute the project, applying FIR filters and feedback delay networks for intricate sound shaping.

This project presents a hands-on opportunity to apply discrete signal processing principles, culminating in a comprehensive sound processing solution. From equalization to effects and real-time manipulation, embark on a journey that blends theory with practical implementation.
