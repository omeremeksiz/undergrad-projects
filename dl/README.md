# Undergraduate Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects completed during my undergraduate studies, including coursework, mini-research projects, and published papers.

## Projects

### 1. DeepTL-SpinalDetection
Transfer learning approach for spinal condition detection using GoogLeNet architecture. The model classifies spinal conditions from medical images.

### 2. MedGAN-Synthetic-Images
Research on generating synthetic medical images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address data scarcity in medical imaging.
- Presented paper included
- Includes acceptance letter and certificate

### 3. MicroOrganism-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network implementation for microorganism classification, featuring:
- Multi-class classification of various microorganism species
- Comprehensive visualization outputs
- Detailed performance analysis

### 4. SkinCancer-TL-Classification
Transfer Learning approach for skin cancer image classification.
- Presented paper: "Performance Analysis of Deep Transfer Learning to Classify Skin Cancer Images"
- Includes acceptance letter
