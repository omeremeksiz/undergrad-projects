Communication Engineering Projects

Project 1: Implementation of various signal processing techniques using MATLAB.

Project Description:
This repository contains the implementation of communication engineering concepts. The project focuses on signal processing, modulation, and demodulation techniques. Each question is addressed individually:

Question 1
a) Voice Recording and Downsampling
b) Spectral Analysis
c) Low Pass Filter
d) Repetition at 4 kHz

Question 2
a) Modulation and Noise Addition
b) Demodulation and Comparison

Question 3
a) USB Modulation
b) Demodulation and Noise Consideration

Project 2: Explore various modulated transmissions and analyze their performance using MATLAB and Simulink.

Project Description:
This repository showcases my understanding of modulated transmissions, including MPAM, MQAM, MPSK, and MFSK, through MATLAB and Simulink implementations.

Question 1
a) Bit Error Rate Analysis - MPAM and MQAM
b) Bit Error Rate Analysis - 16PSK and 16-QAM

Question 2
MFSK Transmission Analysis
